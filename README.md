# controletv

Sample Flutter application demonstrating a simple TV remote.

The app includes two screens:

- **TV Discovery**: scans the local network for compatible televisions using
  UPnP/SSDP and mDNS protocols.
- **Remote Control**: provides basic controls such as volume, channel, menu and
  access to smart apps.

This code is meant as a starting point for integrating real TV control APIs.
